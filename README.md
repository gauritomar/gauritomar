# 💫 About Me:
Hello there! I'm Gauri Tomar, a deep learning researcher at Samajh.ai, where I dive into the fascinating world of computer vision and neural networks. I like to think of myself as a "visionary" who loves solving puzzles using pixels!<br><br>My GitHub repositories are a mixed bag of projects that showcase my expertise in various programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy both back-end and front-end development, always looking to create user-friendly experiences that make people go "Wow!" instead of "What?!"<br><br>Collaboration and teamwork play a pivotal role in my professional approach. Apart from my role as a researcher, I keep abreast of the latest industry trends, attending conferences and staying engaged with relevant online communities. This continuous learning ensures that I stay at the forefront of technological advancements and maintain a comprehensive understanding of the field.
